What is Git?
	Distributed Version control System (VCS) that helps developers track their codebases, collaborate with
other and manage multiple versions of a project.
-> Git is decentralized, which means you don't need a central server. Instead every developer has a full copy 
  of the repo on their machine.
-> Must have sill for every developer. you need to at least know the basics (add, commit, push etc).

Key Features of Git :
  -> Distributed System
  -> Version Tracking
  -> Collaboration
  -> Branching
  -> Merging
  -> Remote Repositories
  -> Extensive Tooling
  -> Staging Area
  -> Speed
  -> Open-Source & Free
  
What is GitHub?
	Web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. it hosts repositories and provides an
interface to manage your code and do many other things.
-> GitHub offers collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, task management & wikis.
-> Git is the VCS and GitHub hosts repositories. There are many other platforms that can host Git repos, 
  Such as Gitlab & BitBucket.

Installing Git:
URL : git-scm.com/downloads

Git Workflow:


After Installing git:

$ git config --global user.name "Z3ncryptedbu9"
$ git config --global user.email "Z3ncryptedBu9@gmail.com"

for checking user name & email
$ git config --global user.name 
Z3ncryptedBu9
$ git config --global user.email
Z3ncryptedBu9@gmail.com

-> seting default branch as main
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main


=== git init ===

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/raj-kumar/Desktop/Git&GitHub/Example repo/.git/

-> Initialize new repository in your Working Directory (project folder)
-> This creates a new hidden folder called .git

TO check:
$ ls -a
TO Delete:
$ rm -rf .git

-> In VsCode files are shown in Untracked means they are in working directory

=== git status ===
$ git status 
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        Digitalclockbackground.png
        clock.css
        clock.html
        clock.js

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

-> It shows the status of each file

=== git add ===
$ git add index.html
-add single file by name
or
$ git add .     
-Adds all the file

-> Add your files to the "Staging Area"
-> you specify the files or use a period for all files

=== git commit ===
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
-m : message

-> Commit your files to local repository on your machine
-> It goes as created a Local Repository
-> you can commit as often as you would like

=> Upto here all are local machine.

--- Making changes ---
-> If we write any line of code that is commited in local repo then
-> status as changed as Modified.

so,we can add the file again
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'add console'

=== git log ===
-It shows started with most recent one

$ git log
commit 43c161c3872c80c718db369ec9419951a06a5dfb (HEAD -> main)

    Initial commit Message
    

=== Remote Repository ===
-- GitHub repo --
-> push to your repository
-> this could be Github or another service like Gitlab or BitBucket.

Step 1 : Create a repository in GitHub profile
Step 2 : run your system given commands
$ git remote add github https://github.com/N220556/LearnGit-GitHub.git
$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u github main
Username : N220556
Password : 
-> We can enter password to generate token from github
step 1: go to url: https://github.com/settings/tokens
step 2 : give name (Git Access)
	 set expire date(minimum) and select Scope (repo all)
step 3 : Generate token
step 4 : enter your token as password
=== git pull ===
-> pull changes from the remote repo to your local machine.
-> Others users may make changes. You pull their changes to your machine
$ git pull

=== .gitignore file ===
-> anything puts in this file not belongs to repository.
-> in our example it holds .env file which stores API_key

=======
$ git commit -am "Without add direct"
$ git push
=======
$ git add index.html && git commit -m "Single line commmand"
$ git push

=================
Downloading : You can download a zip of the repo (can't do pull, add, commit with zip)
git clone : Get a copy of the full repo on to your machine.
git pull : Get the latesy changes from a repo
git fetch : Get latest changes without merging.
forking : Copy a repository into your own account.

======== Branching =====
$ git checkout -b feature/newbranch
Switched to a new branch 'feature/newbranch'
$ git branch
* feature/newbranch
  main
  
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "New branch page"
$ git push -u github feature/main

==== pull request & merge ===
-> done github gui

--- by locally--
$ git merge feature/newbranch
---- delete branch locally --- 
$ git branch -d feature/newbranch


======= CI/CD Pipeline with vercel (for hosting projects) =====
-> Hobby package is free one
-> Deploy your repository, as a website.
-> we change anything push into repo it directly goes to website.
